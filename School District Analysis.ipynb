    "1. Out of 15 schools, the top performing schools were all charter schools while district schools had the lower overall passing average. The student population for the charter schools range from small to medium school sizes. \n",
    "2. The school budget per student doesn't seem to improve the overall passing average for the schools. The schools with lower budget per student has the highest overall passing average while schools with a higher budget per student has a lower overall passing grade. \n",
    "3. Small school sizes with less than 1000 students tend to score higher in their standardized tests than larger school sizes with more than 3000 students. This may be due to greater focus on individual students\n",
    "4. Charter schools were smaller in size and had on average a lower student budget compared to district schools. Based on the data collected,there seems to be a negative correlation between school size and overall passing average. There is also a negative correlation between the budget per student and overall passing average. \n",
    "\n",
    "Increasing budget funding doesn't appear to improve overall passing average in schools. Factors that were not recorded, such as quality of teaching, may affect overall performance. I would recommend proritizing the school budget to hire quality instructors and see if this may immprove passing average.  \n"
